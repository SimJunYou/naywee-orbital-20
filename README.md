Team Naywee's Orbital 20 Project

## WEBSITE BRANCH

### Structure

The `client` folder is for the React frontend, which serves as the interface for our website.
The `server` folder is for the Express backend, which serves as the REStful API that the frontend uses to perform CRUD operations in our Heroku Postgres database.

### Deploying

This branch is pushed manually onto the Heroku remote repo where the Heroku app is launched from.

(NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

The Express server will be built and launched first, followed by the React server using the heroku-postbuild script.
